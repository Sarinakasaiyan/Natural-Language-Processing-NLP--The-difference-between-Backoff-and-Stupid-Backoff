The provided code implements a language model called **Stupid Backoff**, which is used to estimate the probabilities of word sequences (n-grams) in natural language processing. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the code works:

1. **Class Definition**: 
   - The class `StupidBackoffLanguageModel` is defined with a parameter $$ n $$ (the maximum n-gram order) and uses a dictionary to store counts of n-grams.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The `train` method takes input sentences, splits them into various n-grams (from unigrams to n-grams of order $$ n $$), and records the counts of each n-gram.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The `stupid_backoff_probability` method calculates the probability of a specific n-gram. If the n-gram exists, its probability is computed as the ratio of its count to the total count of similar n-grams.
   - If the n-gram is not found, the model backs off to lower-order n-grams (using a fixed scaling factor of 0.4) and continues this process down to unigrams.

4. **Example Usage**:
   - In the example section, the model is trained with three sentences, and then it calculates and prints the probabilities for specific trigrams, bigrams, and unigrams.

This model is appreciated for its simplicity and efficiency in natural language processing applications, especially in scenarios where data is sparse.
